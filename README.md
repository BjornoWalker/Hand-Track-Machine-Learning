# HandTrack-Machine-Learning
Tracks if hand is in proximity to the camera input of your webcam. It will then produce an audio response to that interaction. You can change the audio response that is created if your hand is tracked in the camera patch by adjusting the audio tags src in index.html. The hand tracking app will work with any .mp3 files that you may want to substitute.
